# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains what information is collected when you use the **JuleKonkurrencer** app, how **JuleKonkurrencer** uses it, and what choices you have.

**JuleKonkurrencer** is built by **Hartvig Solutions** as a **free app**. This **Service** is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.

By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Any personal information that we collect is only used to provide and improve the Service. We do **not** use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

Terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions (if available), unless otherwise defined here.

## Information Collection and Use

### Data you enter in the app

JuleKonkurrencer is designed as a simple tool to keep track of Christmas calendar competitions. In the app you can add information such as:

* Name/title of a competition
* Type (website, app, physical, email, etc.)
* Links to external websites
* Notes you write yourself

This information is stored **locally on your device** and is only used to show and manage your list of competitions. We do **not** upload this user-entered content to our own servers.

### Analytics and technical data

To improve the app and understand how it is used, we may use analytics services (for example Firebase Analytics or similar). These services can collect information such as:

* App usage (which screens are used, basic interactions)
* Device type and operating system version
* Approximate location (e.g. country/region)
* Anonymous identifiers used for analytics

This data is generally collected in an aggregated or pseudonymous form and is used only for:

* Monitoring stability and performance
* Understanding which features are used
* Improving the Service over time

We do **not** use analytics data to personally identify you.

### Third-party services

The app may use third-party services that collect information used to identify you, such as:

* Google Play Services
* Firebase Analytics
* Other similar analytics or crash reporting tools

These third-party services have their own privacy policies governing how they handle data.

In addition, JuleKonkurrencer may contain links to **external websites** and open **other apps** (such as supermarket apps or brand campaign pages). When you follow these links, you are subject to the privacy policies of those websites/apps. We do not control and are not responsible for how those third parties collect or use your data.

## Cookies

JuleKonkurrencer itself does **not** use cookies.

However, when you open external websites from the app (for example competition pages in your browser), those websites may use cookies to remember your login, form data or preferences. These cookies are managed by the websites themselves, not by JuleKonkurrencer.

You can control cookies via your browser settings and the cookie banners on those websites.

## Location Information

The app does **not** actively track your precise GPS location.

Analytics services may collect approximate information (such as country or region) based on your IP address in order to provide aggregated usage statistics. We only use this information to understand and improve the Service.

## Device Information

We may collect limited technical information from your device through analytics and crash reporting tools, such as:

* Device model
* Operating system version
* Anonymous identifiers
* Crash logs and performance metrics

This information helps us:

* Improve app performance
* Diagnose and fix bugs
* Prevent abuse or misuse

This data is not used to personally identify you.

## Service Providers

We may employ third-party companies and individuals to:

* Facilitate the Service
* Provide the Service on our behalf
* Perform Service-related tasks
* Assist us in analyzing how the Service is used

These third parties may have access to certain data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.

## Security

We value your trust in providing us with information and we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect it.

However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we aim to protect your data, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Children’s Privacy

This Service is **not** directed at children under the age of 13.

We do **not knowingly** collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information as soon as possible.

If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we can take appropriate action.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time.

You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any updates by posting the new Privacy Policy within the app or on a related website or app store listing.

Changes are effective immediately after they are posted.
