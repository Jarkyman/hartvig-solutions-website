# Privacy Policy

At Zip Flow, your privacy is a top priority. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle any personal information or data associated with your use of the Zip Flow application ("the App").

## 1. Data Collection
We do not collect, store, or share any personal, identifiable data. Any game progress, stars earned, or preferences set within the App are stored entirely locally on your device using Shared Preferences.

## 2. Analytics
The App utilizes basic, anonymized analytics (e.g., Firebase) to track user retention and level completion rates. This helps us understand which levels are too hard or too easy. This data does not contain identifiable information such as your name, email address, or specific device identifiers.

## 3. In-App Purchases and Subscriptions
Currently, the App utilizes platforms (e.g., Apple App Store or Google Play) to process In-App Purchases. Payment information is securely handled by the respective store. We do not have access to, nor do we store, your credit card or billing information. Purchase validation tokens may be used to verify transactions securely.

## 4. Third-Party Links
The App may contain links to our social media, App Store ratings page, or websites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

## 6. Contact Us
If you have any questions or suggestions regarding our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us at support@hartvigsolutions.com.
